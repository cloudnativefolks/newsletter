### 1.Project Carvel: Composable Tools for Application Management

Project Carvel provides a suite of reliable, single-purpose, and composable tools designed for application management. This comprehensive overview highlights the functionalities and use cases of various tools within the Project Carvel ecosystem, demonstrating their practical applications through examples.

- **Composability and Reliability**: The core philosophy behind Project Carvel is to offer a set of tools that are both composable and reliable. Each tool is designed to perform a specific task, ensuring simplicity and effectiveness in managing applications.

- **Tools Overview**:
    - **ytt (YAML Templating Tool)**: ytt is a powerful tool for templating YAML configurations. It understands YAML as a data structure, enabling users to manipulate YAML in unique ways. ytt is versatile, supporting not just Kubernetes resources but also any YAML-based configurations like GitHub actions.
    - **kapp**: kapp is used for deploying and managing resources on Kubernetes clusters. It treats resources as a group and understands the dependencies between them, ensuring that resources are applied in a sensible order and reflecting the desired state accurately.
    - **kbld (Kubernetes Build)**: kbld focuses on managing image references in configuration files. It resolves image tags to immutable digests, ensuring that the exact images used during development are the ones deployed to production.
    - **imgpkg**: imgpkg is designed for bundling, distributing, and versioning configurations using OCI images. It allows for the creation of versioned bundles that can be relocated across registries, supporting air-gapped environments and ensuring integrity through immutability.
    - **Carvel Packaging APIs**: These APIs facilitate the distribution and installation of software across Kubernetes clusters. They provide a higher-level abstraction over the lower-level tools, enabling easier management and deployment of applications.

- **Practical Demonstration**: The presenters showcased practical uses of each tool, starting with ytt to template and manipulate YAML configurations, then moving to kapp for deployment management. They demonstrated how kbld secures image references and how imgpkg bundles configurations for distribution. Finally, they discussed the Carvel Packaging APIs, which streamline the deployment process across different environments.

- **Interoperability and Flexibility**: A key theme of the presentation was the interoperability and flexibility of the Carvel tools. They can be used independently or together, depending on the needs of the project. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to various deployment scenarios and requirements.

- **Community and Support**: The presentation concluded with an emphasis on community engagement and support. The Carvel team encourages feedback and contributions, offering multiple channels for communication and collaboration.

### Insights based on numbers
- The presentation covers the usage and capabilities of five main Carvel tools, focusing on their individual and combined applications for managing Kubernetes applications effectively.

- Demonstrations included examples of YAML manipulation, showing the depth of control and customization available to developers for their deployment configurations.

#### When They Go High, We Go Low – Hooking Libc Calls to Debug Kubernetes Apps - Tal Zwick, MetalBear

This talk, presented by Tal Zwick from MetalBear, delves into innovative low-level techniques used to enhance the development experience of cloud-native applications through a tool named Mird, developed in Rust. The primary focus is on addressing the challenges cloud-native developers face, emphasizing the significance of running and debugging code in environments closely resembling production settings.

### **Key Points:**

- **Objective**: The main challenge tackled is improving the cloud-native developer experience, particularly the ease of running and debugging code. Mird offers a unique solution by enabling developers to execute applications locally while still interacting with cluster resources, bridging the gap between local development and cloud-native environments.

- **Mird Overview**: Mird facilitates the local execution of cloud-native applications with seamless cluster integration. This approach allows developers to maintain productive development practices without compromising the complexity inherent in cloud-native applications. It essentially merges the simplicity of local development with the robustness of cloud-native operations.

- **Technical Insights**: A considerable portion of the talk is dedicated to the technical underpinnings of Mird. Key techniques include:
    - Hooking libc functions using the dynamic instrumentation toolkit, Frida, to intercept and manipulate system calls, directing them towards cluster resources when necessary.
    - Employing dynamic libraries for process-level virtualization, creating a transparent connection between the local development environment and cluster resources.
    - Utilizing environment variables and configuration flags to determine the execution context (local vs. cluster) for specific operations.

- **Development Workflow**: Mird enhances the development workflow by allowing for real-time debugging and interaction with live data and services within the cluster. This setup supports a more intuitive and efficient debugging process, facilitating immediate feedback and iteration.

- **Demonstration**: The presentation includes a live demonstration showcasing Mird’s capabilities, particularly its ability to run, debug, and interact with cloud-native applications as if they were deployed in the cluster. The demo highlights the ease of setup and the seamless transition between local and cluster resources.

- **Challenges and Solutions**: Challenges such as code injection on macOS due to security mechanisms and supporting various libc versions are addressed. Mird's approach to these challenges emphasizes its versatility and commitment to supporting a wide range of development environments.

### **Insights based on numbers:**

- Mird's development encompasses **multiple low-level programming techniques** and tools, including the use of Frida for hooking libc calls and dynamic libraries for process virtualization.
