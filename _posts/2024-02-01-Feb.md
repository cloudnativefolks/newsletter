### Monthly Repository Showcase :

1Ô∏è‚É£ [PoiEx](https://github.com/doyensec/PoiEx) - PoiEx is a Visual Studio Code extension designed for exploring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and enhancing manual code review processes. It integrates Semgrep for scanning, allows interactive exploration of infrastructure via diagrams generated by Inframap, and supports real-time collaboration through notes and findings synced with MongoDB. It aims to visualize points of intersection between web applications and underlying infrastructure, aiding in identifying security vulnerabilities. For more detailed information and to try it out, you can visit the GitHub repository
2Ô∏è‚É£ [kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) - Kubeconform is a fast Kubernetes manifests validator, supporting Custom Resources. It's designed for high performance, capable of validating and downloading manifests concurrently, and allows validating Kubernetes custom resources by configuring remote or local schema locations. It uses a self-updating fork of the Kubernetes JSON schema project, ensuring up-to-date schema validation. For more details, visit their GitHub repository
3Ô∏è‚É£ [kubestellar](https://github.com/kubestellar/kubestellar) - KubeStellar operates as a unique postal service tailored for your Kubernetes resources, akin to how a traditional post office handles parcels without peeking inside. Instead of executing your Kubernetes resources immediately, KubeStellar securely holds and dispatches these resources to specified clusters globally, encompassing public and private clouds as well as edge locations. This mechanism is invaluable for distributing your Kubernetes resources wherever they're needed, seamlessly integrating into your current tools and processes without any disruption.
KubeStellar meticulously avoids prematurely executing your Kubernetes resources by introducing them into a specially designed staging area (akin to a virtual cluster) where pod creation is not permitted. Following your command, KubeStellar efficiently relocates your resources to targeted clusters capable of initiating pods and fulfilling other essential resource requirements. This process leverages a variety of nimble virtual cluster providers (such as Kind, KubeFlex, KCP, and others) to establish this distinct staging environment.
By offering a groundbreaking approach to queue inactive Kubernetes resources and subsequently deploying them across any cluster, KubeStellar presents a pioneering solution to enhance, streamline, and safeguard your Kubernetes resources against the pitfalls of cluster-specific misconfigurations, resource utilization issues, and failures
