<p><strong>1.Flowpilot</strong></p>

<p>Looking for an open-source driver assistance system that can run on most Windows/Linux and Android-powered machines? Check out Flowpilot! This system, built on top of Openpilot, offers Adaptive Cruise Control, Automated Lane Centering, Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, and Driver Monitoring for a growing variety of supported car makes and models maintained by the community. To run Flowpilot on your car, all you need is a supported machine, a white/grey or black/red panda with a car harness, and one of the 200+ supported cars. Don‚Äôt see your car on the list? If it has adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, it can likely run Flowpilot. Learn more by visiting their</p>

<p><strong>2.Vuls</strong></p>

<p>As a system administrator, constantly performing security vulnerability analysis and software updates can be a burden. Skipping automatic updates to avoid downtime may seem like a quick fix, but it can lead to a host of problems. With a large number of software packages, it‚Äôs impossible to monitor everything, and analysis to determine affected servers is expensive. Luckily, Vuls is here to help. It automatically detects vulnerabilities and informs users of affected servers, preventing any oversight. Plus, regular reports are generated for easy vulnerability management. Say goodbye to the burden of manual updates with Vuls.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/future-architect/vuls"><img src="https://github-link-card.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/future-architect/vuls.png" width="460px" /></a></p>

<p><strong>3.container2wasm</strong></p>

<p>Introducing container2wasm: A container-to-wasm image converter that allows you to run your container on WASM! This experimental software converts x86_64 or riscv64 containers to WASM with emulation by Bochs and TinyEMU. It runs on WASI runtimes, including wasmtime, wamr, wasmer, wasmedge, and wazero, and even on your browser! Other platforms, such as arm64, also work but at a slower pace. Check out the demo page of containers on the browser, including debian, python, node, and vim, at https://lnkd.in/gH8PKqKc. Give it a try today with just one simple command: $ c2w ubuntu:22.04 out.wasm. The above command converts¬†ubuntu:22.04¬†container image to WASI image (out.wasm).</p>

<p><strong>5.SSH-Snake</strong></p>

<p>Are you tired of manually traversing a network to identify its dependencies? Look no further than SSH-Snake! This powerful tool automatically maps a network and its dependencies by utilizing SSH private keys discovered on systems. With SSH-Snake, you can quickly identify potential vulnerabilities and the extent to which a network can be compromised using SSH and SSH private keys. The tool automates the process of finding SSH private keys, hosts, and destinations, and then attempts to SSH into all the discovered destinations using the private keys. SSH-Snake is completely self-replicating and self-propagating, making it a highly efficient and effective tool. Say goodbye to the tedious process of jumping between systems with SSH keys. SSH-Snake is here to do the work for you. Check out the documentation and script</p>

<p><strong>7.Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting</strong></p>

<p>Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown and JSON? Azure Governance Visualizer is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant¬¥s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data Azure Governance Visualizer provides visibility on your HierarchyMap, creates a TenantSummary, creates DefinitionInsights and builds granular ScopeInsights on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal. You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group.
